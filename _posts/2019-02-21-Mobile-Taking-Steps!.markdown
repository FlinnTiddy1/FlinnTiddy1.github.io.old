Web was full up so I ended up with my second choice of mobile, this will help my mobile skills improve quickly I think as Im also taking Mobile Design and Development paper this semester at the same time.

Joon Lee and I are a two person team and have been assigned to continue the work on the fitness application previously called Walking With Leon but now Taking Steps. The app is still very far from being finished after a quick look through the code. The code from the pervious students looks qutie complicated and messy in some areas with uncomplete work.

The app's main feature is google maps intergration as the map tracks the route you have walked.

Joon and I investigated through the app to see where its been left and make a plan for us to carry on and finish the work. Alot of the app's functions do nothing and the design is below average. We create a list of issues to start working on to fix.
