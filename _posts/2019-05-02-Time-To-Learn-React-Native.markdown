Adon called a meeting for all mobile project teams and let us know that we will all be re creating our current work into React Native instead of Java + Android Studio. This surprised us all and meant we needed to begin learning how to code in React as none of us had any experience in this language. 

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook. It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities. React is also developed by Facebook.

I feel this switch to React Native was a good move as its a more common way to create applications in the real world. Android Studio is very outdated and I feel this will help us in the future if we wanted to become mobile developers after finishing the BIT at polytechnic with skill in more relevant areas.

My task is start learning React Native, firstly need to set up React Environment using React CLI and I can run my app's using the Android Studio AVD.<br><br><br>
