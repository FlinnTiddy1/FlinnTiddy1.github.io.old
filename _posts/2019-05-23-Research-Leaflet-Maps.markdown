After a quick chat with Adon he wanted me to research and look into map alternatives like Leaflet. I began looking online for resources to start implementation of a new map service but quickly found leaflet for react native was lacking on documentation online and people warned against it. I didn't take their advice and pushed forward to try and getting it working in Taking Steps. I found tutorial from a github user called Reggie3 and began importing the react native modules using npm. Working through the tutorial I struggled to get anything functioning properly and couldn't refer to any of resources because this was the only one I found after a solid hours of googling.

React-Native-Maps using Google's API is a wiser decision for our map component in Taking Steps.

There seemed to be plenty of documentation on React versions of leaflet but nothing on React Native, after messing around with the code for too many hours I finally called it and choose not to continue with Leaflet, In a future project I feel leaflet would work well but not until its more supported in React Native platform.
