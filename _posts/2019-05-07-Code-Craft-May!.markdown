As part of my external enagement for project 1, I choose to attend a month code craft meeting / talk which are host on Tuesdays at 5pm on the ground floor of H block.

**Code Craft Desciption** - Read here for useful information. We are a group of people interested in software development, learning and getting together. The group consists of members of the local IT development and educational community.

The talk today was on distributed revision control and history of GIT, this was helpful as its very relevant to my project work for keeping a up to date version between Joon and I for Taking Steps app.

Overall I think code craft was a good experience as it helped me learn in a enviroment of like minded people all trying to improve their knowledege and skills in IT.
