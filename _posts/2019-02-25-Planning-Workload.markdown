Joon and I decided we need some sort of ticket management system to make sure we work effectively and have a system to prove what work each person has completed for our portfolios. We keep a timeline, a issues, do later, assigned tasks and solved section to keep track of our progress.

Today Addon also added us to the repo of Taking Steps and gave us rights to be able to push to master for the updates we roll out.

We created a large list of issues here at our [Trello Board][trello-link]
