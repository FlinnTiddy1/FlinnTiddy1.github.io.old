20% Documentation task given by Adon today in a quick meeting with him, wants me to take my research on leaflet and compare it to React-Native-Maps. 

This will be a interesting write up as a struggled with leaflet maps for weeks and started to hate it with a passion due to it lack of support on React Native. This was apart of Adons master plan as he wanted to "test" me to find the best option for Taking Steps.
