Had another quick meeting with Adon today, we discussed the future plans of the application with one of the big things being the design. Personally I don't like the design of Taking Steps at all, it isn't appealing, doesn't have a theme and has no meaning. A better design will definitely be created next semester for Taking Steps to allow for a more user friendly and creative look. 

Adon asked me to fix something that he asked the previous students last year to update but never got around to it even if he asked multiple times. He didn't like how the application opened straight away onto the walking page and thought it was a overload of information to the end user. I agreed with this and switched the home page to be the statistics page instead just by flipping buttons on the navigation bar and pushed this to our master branch. 

We also talked about next semester and how Joon and I will be carrying on with this project. We aim to have it complete by end of next semester. I'm not sure if this will be a challenging task or not at this stage, we are  missing a few aspects of the core functionality of the application.

Taking Steps Components Missing -
* Tracking user when walk is active, places markers following route on map.
* Some sort of offline database system to store users information(Users, Goals, Statistics etc).
* Incorporating timer on walk page(Already coded just needs design).
* New colour scheme.
* New design.
* Working Statistics page.
* Working Goals page.
* Sign up page that saves into the database.
* Implement Leons equations to calculate statistics.
* Implement sensors using react native to count steps.

Database is a core aspect we are missing, the users data needs to be saved somewhere after they finish a walk or add a goal for example. I think Joon and I will need to focus on this first when we start our second semester. After we get all the functionality that Leon has asked for we will need to polish the application **ALOT** with the main task being design and application feel in my personal opinion.

Showcase is only a week away and I'm not exactly sure what to expect from this event, we don't have a whole lot to 'show' as of right now. The most important task right now for Joon and I will be to make what we have right now as presentable as possible to show lecturers and other students I guess.
