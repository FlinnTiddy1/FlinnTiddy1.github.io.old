Finally started to add some of my code and designs to the app as I completed the login screen and edited the design of the overall project. The application had a very ugly background that didn't relate to the meaning of the app in any way. Joon and I made the decision to get rid of this and just run a simple grey instead for the meantime. 

My main job was to complete the screen that the splash screen would redirect to, currently the login page has no functionally other than a onClick on both buttons that switches intent to the main app screen with the timer and map. I can't add anymore functionality right now as we need to figure out a database system first.
