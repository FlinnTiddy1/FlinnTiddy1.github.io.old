First class of Project 1 started today with a intro into how the project works, the topics, how its marked and what Addon expects from us as we are now third year students.

The workload seems very independant and self directed which means keeping motivation up and staying on top of the work will be very important.

Along with developing our project we will need to do volunteering activites and professional development during the semester. 

Addon left us with the task of deciding which project would be interested in joining, I'd like to join either **Web** or **Mobile** project as I find them the most interesting and will help to further my skills in either area.
