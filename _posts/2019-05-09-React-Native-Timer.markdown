After learning the very basics of React it was time to starting our Taking Steps port. Joon decided to work on the navigation menu and I choose to do the timer that is controlled by a button click to time the length of a users work. The timer will work in conjunction with the map as well to track the user. 

I began researching online on how to implement this and found a good tutorial from my google searches. I pulled relevant elements from this example to use in my project. I developed the timer on a separate project from our main Taking Steps as the project had yet to be pushed to git as Joon had just created it. Will be adding to the main project once I figure out google maps as well as its on the same page.

This is my first time creating a component in React Native and helped me understand the process of installing and using dependencies. Timer currently lacks design but is fully functional with start, stop, pause and clear.
