After finishing my assigned task and Joon completing his, it was time to merge our branches into our master as Adon had request we get a stable version up on the google play store within a few weeks for him and the client Leon.

Our GitFlow was giving us major issues with Joon not being able to merge into the repo, we talked with a third year Student Albert who had A lot of experience with Git. After trying multiple methods suggested by him we made the decision to create a new Repo and all merges after this worked without issue. Was important to fix this because having a effective workflow is core to a successful team and project.
