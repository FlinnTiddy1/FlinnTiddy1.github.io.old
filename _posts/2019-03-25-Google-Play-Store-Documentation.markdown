Google Play Store requires several pieces of documentation to be accepted on the store. Otago Polytechnic have a shared account and have paid the fee to be able to upload. I create the logo and banner quickly as there was no existing assets. The following components are required<br><br>

1. **App Name** - "Taking Steps"
<br><br>
2. **Short Description** - Fitness application to track your walking routes with inbuilt maps and statistics.
<br><br>
3. **Full Description** - Taking Steps is a new app to help you with your day to day walks. The app tracks your routes using google maps, calculates the amount of steps you take during each walking session, and works out the amount of calories each walk you burn and more. Includes two different walking modes, one with a set time and another without which allows you to walk as much as you please. App allows you have multiple users and set goals to reach.

4. **Screenshots** - (Up to 6 images, used more than examples.      )
