After our 2 week holiday/break Joon and I had a meeting on the first session back to see where we currently where workload wise. The version I rolled out to googe play store once again had issues and I was completely out of idea's on what to try next. I decided to go with Adons idea and create a new project to slowly add components to the project while rolling out to the google play store. This should eventually reveal the issue thats causing the failure.

I plan to spend my next couple of seesions doing this process so there can finally be a version live on the google play store for the client and project showcase.
