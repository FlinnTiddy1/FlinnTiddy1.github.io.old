Joon and I had a meeting looking over a Trello board to decide what was the next tasks to take on. Adon had requested the application go live on the google play store as soon as possible so I decided to take the task apon myself. Luckily Albert had previous made a detailed guide on how to upload an app to the play store so I began to read over this and research. Joon had choosen to work out bugs in the app with the timer buttons as they were often glitchy when trying to pause them. 

After planning this sprint, I was happy and confident with our progress on the project as we are still learning mobile and we were in over our heads slightly at the start.
