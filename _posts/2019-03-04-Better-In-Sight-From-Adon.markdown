Joon and I had continued to read code to get a understanding of the project for a week now. Today Adon our project manager called a meeting and talked in depth about the app and what we should do. He draw up a flow chart outlining the flow the application will need to be functional. A splash screen will need to be developed to allow the app to check/fetch the existing user. A login / signup page also needs to be created along with a database that will store the users and their specific data. 

I will be working on the login / sign up screens and Joon on the splash screen.
