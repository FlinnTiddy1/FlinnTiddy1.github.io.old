Today I attended another code craft meeting at 5:30 after class at polytechnic. This brings my total of external engagement up to a total of 4. (2 Code crafts + 2 Volunteering)

**Code Craft Desciption** - Read here for useful information. We are a group of people interested in software development, learning and getting together. The group consists of members of the local IT development and educational community.

Today the talk was on war stories people have had in the IT industry. "How I broke it and got away with it." It was interesting to hear peoples stories as most of the people talking were in their 30-50s with alot of experience in wokring in IT. These talks gave me a better insight of real life day to day activities working as a developer.
