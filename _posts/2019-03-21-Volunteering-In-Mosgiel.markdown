George Alexander, Henry Greenslade and I were all assigned to head down to Mosgiel public library today to help with a IT Help Drop-in centre from 1pm-3pm. 

Wasn't too sure what to expect from this but overall was a good experience helping people out. Most people asking for help were seniors trying to adpat to new techonlogy that us younger generation are use too. One lady I helped was wanting to watch TV shows on demand through her laptop so I helped her setup a TVNZ on demand account and show her how to navigate the website. She also wanted help with internet banking and the process to send someone money. None of this was challenging as it's tasks I do daily without second thinking them.
